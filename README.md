# LSTM_with_numpy
Solar system collect energy while 3 years.
- Timestamp: time of day (I will removed this column)
- kilowatt-hours: number of kilowatt are collected by solar system
- Date: date (I will removed this column)
- TempMin: min of temperate in day
- TempMax: max of temperate in day
- Weatther: kind of weather

We must predict the kilowatt-hours of one day in future based on the data of 700 days in the past.
This test purpose is only show how LSTM model works. The accuracy of model are not good...
